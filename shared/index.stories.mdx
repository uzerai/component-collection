# Component-collection

This is just a fun side-project I'm doing to try to recreate the HackerOne storybook component
in the [TailwindCSS](http://tailwindcss.com) framework.

The project is set up using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)
using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the previously mentioned TailwindCSS framework.
